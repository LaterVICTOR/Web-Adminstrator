# Nginx Configuration for Small Business Website

## Overview

This Nginx configuration is designed for a small business website that serves as an online platform for administrators and users. The site includes a chat feature, a configuration zone, an admin zone, and a status page.

## Features

### 1. Chat
The chat feature enables real-time communication among users, fostering quick discussions and seamless collaboration.

### 2. Configuration Zone
The configuration zone allows users to customize their experience within the application. Users can adjust preferences, notifications, and other settings based on their individual needs.

### 3. Admin Zone
Dedicated to administrators, this section facilitates user management, role assignments, and access to essential administrative tools, providing efficient oversight and control over internal operations.

### 4. Status
The status page offers a snapshot of the current system status. It may include crucial metrics, error reports, and real-time updates to keep users informed about the system's health and performance.
### 5. Styling Customization

You can customize the colors in your styles using CSS variables. Edit the `style.css` file and find the `:root` block to update the color variables.

```css
:root {
        --background-color: #e0e8f4;
        --container-background-color: #d6e6f5;
        --container-border-color: #a8c0da;
        --button-background-color: #4d8cc1;
        --button-hover-color: #306992;
        --link-color: #1a496b;
        --link-hover-color: #1e5799;
}
```

## Nginx Server Configuration

The Nginx server is configured to listen on port 80, with the root directory set to `/var/www/proyectos`. PHP scripts are passed to the FastCGI server, and specific parameters are adjusted to enhance performance and functionality.

### Installation

1. **Install Nginx:**
    - On Debian/Ubuntu:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install nginx
      ```

    - On CentOS:
      ```bash
      sudo yum install epel-release
      sudo yum install nginx
      ```

2. **Install PHP:**
    - On Debian/Ubuntu:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install php-fpm
      ```

    - On CentOS:
      ```bash
      sudo yum install epel-release
      sudo yum install php-fpm
      ```

3. **Configure Nginx:**
    - Copy the provided Nginx configuration to the appropriate location.
    - Adjust the root directory and server_name as needed.
    - Restart Nginx:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart nginx
      ```

4. **Configure PHP:**
    - Ensure PHP-FPM is running:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl start php-fpm
      sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
      ```

### PHP Configuration

Make sure PHP is configured correctly, with the appropriate version and FastCGI settings.
