# Nginx Configuration for Small Business Website

## Overview

This Nginx configuration is designed for a small business website that serves as an online platform for administrators and users. The site includes a chat feature, a configuration zone, an admin zone, and a status page.

## Features

### 1. Chat
The chat feature enables real-time communication among users, fostering quick discussions and seamless collaboration.
